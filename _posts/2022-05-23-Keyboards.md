# Intro

One morning you get up, get ready, drink your coffee and sit down at your desk to do your work. And realize your keyboard just doesn't cut it anymore for you. So you decide to get a mechanical keyboard.

If you, like me, happened to grow up using an (now old) IBM Model F or M, you probably know what happened here. Those loud, massive boards were unwieldy but definitely more satisfying than the cheaper membrane keyboards that became the norm in modern days. This was not so much a problem most of the time. Most people in tech started to primarily type on their laptops keyboards - and did change out these devices often enough so it never became a real bother. Also "physical" typing became an afterthought (if you not were a coder) as most people started communicating primarily using the small virtual keyboards on their phones. 

Gamers, coders and other people heavily reliant on high quality input methods, specifically their keyboards or mice respectively, created a demand and a market for so called custom keyboards... Also social media started to take on sort of a hype. You can review the rise of Taeha Types Channel. This smart youtuber used the attention gamer streamer celebrities were getting.
