Btw, I stand by it (had this a few times already) - This is the same story behind Apple's and others' struggle to keep their app ecosystems either "closed" or "open". Can a company like Apple make sure that all user relevant interactions have to go through their ecosystem and therefore billing system? So, does everything on an iPhone/iPad have to come from the store and everything that comes from the web through their browser - and thus inherently support their payment system, biometrics, account management - in short: Apple's APIs and services? That's what an Epic Games is fighting for.

It seems that the games industry and enterprise app environment are going through the same development in parallel just having different participants.

Example: The companies Valve and Microsoft are trying to achieve basically the same goals with very different means in slightly different arenas - abstraction from the firmly defined access path into the ecosystem. Also, developers should not have to worry about this - as long as they offer their products in the right (market)place.

Microsoft provides the XBox ecosystem for this in the games context. Users can purchase/gain access to apps/games with little (no?) risk. The ecosystem takes care of authentication and also persistence of user data similar to what Office 365/Teams does in a business/enterprise context. This includes data like game saves and settings. Communication services (social sharing, real-time meetings/shared play with audio/video) are also handled by the ecosystem.

Vavle offers something similar with the Steam platform, i.e. identity, trading platform, app marketplace and centralized unified APIs for all these things, including functions inside the games such as cloud saves and achivement systems.

In short, they are also "operating systems" by Stratchery's definition. In detail, one would still have to discuss whether "game engines" like Unreal Engine are possibly still fighting for this title - but not in the view chosen here, since we are concerned with the coexistence and interaction of apps from the user's point of view and also the user's access to app/services.

Is there a difference in the current development between Microsoft's and Valve's approach?

Both companies are trying to enable more users to access these services and also make their services easier and more useful to use in more scenarios. For example, neither company had a sensible answer for how a user can take advantage of the services on the move - for example, while waiting for a train at the station. Not everyone can comfortably unpack a fat gaming laptop to game while waiting for the train at the tracks. Pairing your service primarily with a physical Xbox/Windows PCs/notebooks also becomes an obstacle in this scenario.

Valve's answer is Steam OS and Steam Deck. Almost trying to create a square circle: Offering access to games developed for stationary Windows PC on a Linux-based handheld that rivals a Nintendo Switch in form factor. And doing it while not asking developers to make a single adjustment to their products.

As Valve, you gain users from the casual/mobile environment, compete with Nintendo on the device and can use your huge existing app catalog to shake up the market in the portable environment. Any user who gets involved will appreciate the benefits of the full ecosystem including store, authentication and cross-device persistence of data. Existing users can leverage their investment in more situations (and spend even more time in the ecosystem).

Microft is taking a similar approach with its cloud gaming. A platform that was previously only 100% available on the couch sitting in front of a Xbox and around 80% on the PC is snow uddenly sufficiently accessible on almost any device. You just log in to the service - similar to a teams web client and can access your apps, social network and existing data.

In some cases, this works very well - i.e. access via native apps on Windows, Android or even Xbox itself is hardly distinguishable from the local use of the apps/services. Other access paths via e.g. Safari on iOS still have limitations, especially with latency. That is part of the battle that Apple is waging, because technically there is a native app offered by Microsoft that does not have these problems. You just are not allowed to have it by Apple.

Again, it's about nothing less than full dominance in the user experience. A user should have no advantage to leave the respective ecosystem. Valve and MS focus on the advantage side, but leave it open for the user to use other systems as well. Apple also tries to offer maximum convenience and security - but actively excludes other systems. Other vendors like Sony and Nintendo are on this journey but not yet clear in their vision (or so it seems).
